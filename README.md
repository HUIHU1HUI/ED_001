# ED_001
ED-001 is a vst/au host Max for Live device that allows for more intuitive control over audio plugin parameters, letting the user set two “states” of the plugin to slide between. This not only creates an easier method for automating multiple parameters, giving you continuous control over all of a plugin’s parameters and states; but also doubles as a sound design tool for mixing presets or experimentation. ED-001 also has four mappable dials, giving independent control over specific parameters.
